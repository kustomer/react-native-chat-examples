## Guidelines

**Each pull request SHOULD have the following content**
- Sentence case title
- A brief overview of the changes
- A clickable reference to the relevant Jira ticket
- A screenshot of the visual changes (if applicable)
- Any additional details that make reviewing the request easier
- A description of your verification plan
- A mention of the person or group who should review

**Immediately after creating the pull request**
- Review your own code and add inline comments that might help the reviewer
